        <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
        <p>ESPN</p>

          ESPN uses the rule of thirds by dividing the page into three distinct
          columns with a sidebar on either side and the main column in the
          center. It also uses the scoreboard and navigation links up top, the
          main video, and the smaller videos beneath it to divide it into thirds
          horizontally as well.

        <h3>PARC: Repetition</h3>
        <p>Apple</p>
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple.com</a>

        <p>
          Apple uses repetition and their website all over the place using
          colors, fonts, style, etc. One of the most prevalent places I could
          find repetition was these six cards. Each card has a bold title, a
          description, links, and an image. Each element matches the elements of
          the other cards.

        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <p>Google</p>
        <a href="https://www.google.com">Google.com</a>

        <p>
          Google.com keeps its webpage clean and simple with a lot of white
          space, making the search bar and logo stand out. There aren't many
          extra things to distract you. It is a neat and organized space
          where the search bar is the only thing to focus on. Everything is designed to help you
          easily search for what you need.
